# Data Analysis Project with Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark
## Project Description
This is a team project for the Master's degree course "Large Scale Data Management Systems" (2024), part of the "Data Science & Machine Learning" MSc program at NTUA. The project involves analyzing large datasets using advanced data science techniques and tools, with a focus on Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. The primary objective is to develop practical skills in installing, managing, and utilizing these distributed systems for large-scale data analysis.

Teams consist of two members working together to apply these tools and techniques effectively.

For more details, please refer to the project.pdf file.

## Objectives

* To become familiar with and develop skills in installing and managing the distributed systems Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop.
* To utilize modern techniques through Spark's APIs for large-scale data analysis.
* To understand the capabilities and limitations of these tools in relation to available resources and chosen configurations.

## Datasets
### Primary Dataset
Los Angeles Crime Data: This dataset contains crime records for Los Angeles from 2010 to the present. The data is available in CSV format from the following links:
